# Warehouses

Warehouses Redux: A Factorio mod to store things. Compatible with Factorio 0.15.x.

Largely a retuned version of [Warehousing Mod](https://github.com/Anoyomouse/Warehousing).

Changes from @Anoyomouse's Warehousing mod:
* Updated for 0.15.x
* Removed all logistics warehousing. Only *Storehouse* and *Warehouse* remain.
* Made the items more expensive to craft and more difficult to mine.
* Made the Warehousing research more difficult to attain.
* Added *Iron Chests* as a crafting requirement, so that Iron Chests aren't actually useless.
* Added an expensive version of the Storehouse and Warehouse (Factorio 0.15.x feature)

**Important**: The buildings are not the same entities as in the original version. That means they are not compatible.


## Effects

Adds the following craftable items:

Texture                   | Name       | Slots | Size | Crafting Requirements |
--------------------------|------------|-------|------|-----------------------|
![Storehouse][storehouse] | Storehouse | 800   | 3x3  | 20x Iron Plate, 20x Steel Plate, 20x Stone Brick, 10x Wooden Chest, 10x Iron Chest |
![Warehouse][warehouse]   | Warehouse  | 2000  | 6x6  | 30x Iron Plate, 30x Steel Plate, 40x Stone Brick, 10x Wooden Chest, 10x Iron Chest, 10x Steel Chest |

[warehouse]:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jleclanche/factorio-warehouses/master/graphics/entity/warehouse.png

An expensive version of both items is available and costs exactly twice the items.

The Warehousing research requires **Logistic robotics**, and costs 100x Science Pack 1 and Science Pack 2.
